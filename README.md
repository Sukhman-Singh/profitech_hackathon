# StockBox

StockBox is an investment recommendation app. Based on your income, and the amount you want to invest, we estimate an acceptable level of risk for you and recommend an array of high-quality stocks. Built for the profitech hackathon 2021. 

## How we built it
Our front end was built using javascript, HTML, and CSS. We used the React javascript library to assist in structuring this front end. Our back end is written in Python, using the Flask framework to manage the communication between and front end. The data is being pulled from finviz.com, using custom web scraping scripts.
